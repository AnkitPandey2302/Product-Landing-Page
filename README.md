This is an HTML file that includes CSS code. The CSS code is used to style the HTML elements on the page. The file begins with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which tells the browser that the document is an HTML file.

The file contains several HTML elements such as header, nav, section, div, form, iframe, and footer. These elements are used to structure the content on the page.

The CSS code begins with @import which is used to import a font from Google Fonts. This font is used throughout the page for various elements.

The CSS code also includes several class and ID selectors, such as .logo, #nav-bar, #hero, .grid, .icon, .desc, .product, and #video. These selectors are used to target specific HTML elements on the page and apply styling rules to them.

The page includes links to two external stylesheets, styles.css and https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css. The styles.css file contains additional styling rules for the HTML elements on the page, while the all.css file provides access to the Font Awesome icon library.
